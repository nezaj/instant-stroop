# Stroopwafel

A speed-based game inspired by the [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect). This intended to be a reference app for those who want to hack with [InstantDB](https://instantdb.com).

## Quickstart
Note: This assumes you've already got Expo Go and friends akready set up

```
git clone ...
npm i
make dev
```

You should now have a local server running Stroopwafel! Fire up the simulator or scan the QR code with your phone to test it out!
